# NHENTAI READER - INIFINITY FAVORITE RANDOM PICKER WITH AUTO SCROLL AND PAGINATION 

Thank you for visits! Very happy to see people enjoied. The current code still it might work but you will go through a lot of trouble because the lib is getting depreciated. I'm rewriting with other lib and will document step by step!. 

Thanks

This is a simple and shit ruby script written with 'watir-webdrive' gem to automate the use of nhentai.
You just have to put your username and password and just run program.

## What it does ?
It creates a new instance of chrome incognito mode which will run infinitely a while loop to pick randomly a doujinsh
from your favorite list. It has an smooth auto scroll due the image size and auto pagination. Hands free!

You can speed up things changing the sleep values.
